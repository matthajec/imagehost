# Imagehost Server

## Description
This is the client for my image hosting service. You can upload .jpg, .jpeg, .png, and .webp files under 2MB, then you can access and share them via a URL that you can copy with the click of a button.

## Built With
* React
* SASS/SCSS

## What I Learned
* How drag events don't give you the properties of the files (this one took me a long time to figure out...)
* How to validate file size and type on the client
* How to implement file drag and drop feilds with custom animations and effects based on what the user is doing.

## Challenges
* Handling the drag and drop functionality
